# CV Builder App

Done for the fulfillment of this Odin Project Lesson. -> https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application

### Live Site: https://cv-maker-beige.vercel.app/

## Tools Used:

- Vite React Project Creator
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Usestate
- Vanilla Javascript
- React Icons

## Story:

I once tried to create my cv online but couldn't find a free website/app for that. (I think I didn't google properly.)
So this time when I had to work on this project I went an extra mile and made it almost perfet. I think it will help some(at least me. ha ha!)

## Learnings:

- How to add and show image without uploading to database.
- How to make the preview part visible on all devices. (Sweet CSS scale feature. )
- A great combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox to create whole layout
- Huge amount of usestate usage and props usage. Miss you context api..

## Improvements that I can think of:

- I allowed adding upto 5 degree and experience field. Only 2 Referrence, 2 other info. There are ways to allow unlimited entry but for this project I kept it that way.
- For print feature I am using PC/Mobiles Print feature which might not work well when the CV is more than 1 page long and has colored background.

### What else? Do you have a feedback?
